Hyde Park-Image Nation and Troika Pictures have announced that actor-singer Nick Jonas will star as the male lead opposite Isabel Lucas in the edgy thriller Careful What You Wish For. The film is directed by Elizabeth Allen (The Vampire Diaries, Aquamarine) and written by Chris Frisina and Gregg Hurwitz. Careful What You Wish For will be the Grammy-nominated musician’s first lead acting role in a feature film. Jonas made his Broadway debut in the lead role of 2011’s revival of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.
