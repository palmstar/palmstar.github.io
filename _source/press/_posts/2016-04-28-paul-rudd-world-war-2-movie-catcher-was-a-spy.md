Paul Rudd is set to star in the World War II film “The Catcher Was a Spy,” sources confirmed to Variety. Ben Lewin is on board to direct the movie, which PalmStar Media is producing and financing. Rudd will play Moe Berg, an Ivy League grad and attorney who goes on to play baseball for 15 years for teams that included the Chicago White Sox. What was unknown to his teammates was that Berg doubled as a top secret spy for the OSS (a forerunner for the CIA), who helped the U.S. win the race against Germany to build the atomic bomb.
