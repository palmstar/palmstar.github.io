In a pre-American Film Market move, Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg have come on board indie comedy “American Ultra,” with shooting set for April. FilmNation will launch foreign sales at AFM. CAA is repping U.S. rights. “Ultra” will re-team Stewart and Eisenberg five years after they starred in Greg Mottola’s “Adventureland.”
