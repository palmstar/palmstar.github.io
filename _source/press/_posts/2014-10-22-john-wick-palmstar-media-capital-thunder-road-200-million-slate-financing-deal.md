On the eve of the opening of their Keanu Reeves-starrer John Wick, PalmStar Media Capital and Thunder Road Pictures have made an overall financing deal that will give Basil Iwanyk’s production company more than $200 million in equity annually to fully finance and produce five to six star-driven films with budgets between $20 million and $50 million. PalmStar has the option to finance or co-finance the bigger-budget films. Iwanyk’s company will also have over $5 million in development capital to percolate projects in the deal he has closed with PalmStar Media CEO Kevin Frakes.
